This is an analysis of the HRS data to find the average caregiving hours per prevalent case of dementia per week. The analysis also aims to find the demographic information of the people who helped the respondent with dementia, and to then calculate the total amount of hours that each specific demographic group contributed (so, for instance, how many hours per week of total dementia care are attributable to males, 35-44, with a bachelor's degree?).

First, to begin analysis we must identify which respondents have dementia. The Langa-Weir classification is one that has been empirically validated, so we downloaded their data and merged it with the HRS core datasets https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/langa-weir-classification-cognitive-function

The HRS dataset is released each year in numerous individual files depending on the category of the question. All of the files related to helping are in file G, and then questions that pertain to the helper themselves are in the HP (helper) file for G. So, all of the relevant information was found in the G HP file. More information about specific variables used in the analysis can be found in the codebook https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/documentation/codebooks

We converted the information the respondent provided about the nature of their help into an hours-per-week format, and then we capped the number of hours at 168. 168 would mean if they said 24 hours a day)

The demographic information for the helpers is found in a variety of ways. Many are gathered from the RAND Longitudinal file or the RAND Family Data file, which compile responses from all the waves into one individual file: https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/rand To start, almost all helpers have a gender listed, so in the event that no other demographic information can be found, they can be grouped by their gender alone. Next, many helpers are spouses of the main respondent, and in which case they almost always are also respondents themselves, so by matching up their unique identifiers with the data from the RAND Longitudinal File, we can pull demographic information on age and education as well. In addition, many helpers are children of the respondent, and in such a case there is demographic data in the RAND Family Data file. The RAND Family Data file was only updated to the 2014 wave at the time of analysis, however, so for the 2016 and 2018 analyses we also included information taken from the Preload and Family Structure questionnaires in the core survey for that wave year in addition to the RAND Family Data file.
